# Insurance Cross-Selling
This project aims to predict customer interest in vehicle insurance based on various features. 
The project involves data analysis, feature engineering, and model training.



## Data
The data comes from ...

## Limitations
* Imbalanced data:
* Lack of customer diversity: All customers have not been with the company for more than 1 year. 
That saying, their level of loyalty is probably not high enough to even think of cross-selling a new insurance type.

## Methodology
Applied 3 models Random Forest Classifier, Weighted Random Forest Classifier, Weighted CatBoost Classifier.
Since the data is heavily imbalanced, it was recommened to weight it.

## Conclusions
